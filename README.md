# Unfolding_Data
Simulated and experimental data required to perform unfolding, and the associated results

To manipulate this data you need to:

1) Install Root (https://root.cern.ch/downloading-root)
2) Get have access to the tools developed by the BANG group (contact Bethany Goldblum or Josh Brown)
3) Clone the nsd-geant4 and nsd-rootscripts repositories
4) In {}/root/etc/system.rootrc, modify the Unix.*.Root.MacroPath: by adding ":/home/pyne-user/Dropbox/UCB/Research/ETAs/88Inch/Unfolding/nsd-rootscripts/root_helper_classes" to the end of the current path
5) In Type "make" in terminal in the directory "home/pyne-user/Dropbox/UCB/Research/ETAs/88Inch/Unfolding/nsd-geant4/TreeClasses"
6) In {}/root/etc/system.rootrc, modify the Unix.*.Root.MacroPath: by adding ":/home/pyne-user/Dropbox/UCB/Research/ETAs/88Inch/Unfolding/nsd-geant4/TreeClasses" to the end of the current path

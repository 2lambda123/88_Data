The runExample.bat file can be run to automatically generate the
  Example Case output.  This just simplifies generation of the
  Example Case.  Running SHIELD from the command line is easy and
  produces the following output.


> shield

 SHIELD -- Program to calculate neutron shelf-shielding using NJOY/NJpp output
   version 1.2.0, 2015-08-05

  Enter the name of the SHIELD run parameters file [shldinput.dat]:
shldinput.dat

  Specify either the number of energy groups (69, 129, 140, 175, 640, or 725)
    or provide the name of a file in which the energy grid structure is
    defined [140]:
140
 Proceeding...


 SHIELD Finished!



SHIELD can be used in the same way to process the NJpp output file 
  (shld_xsect.out) to generate a SHIELD library for a different energy
  group configuration.

# # makes line a comment
# //# starts global definitions for the processing
# the next line should begin with the number of samples for the baseline
#   tracker, then the clipping value
# /# starts definition of parameters for a new channel
# next line should be a channel number
# next line should be a psd method {0,1,2,3} for {tailToPeak,tailToTotal,deltaT,none}
#    followed by the correct number of parameters on the same line
# next line 0 / 1 should be the first character of the next line defining whether there
#    are pile up rejection parameters
# next line should be a time method {0,1,2} for {leadingEdge,constantFraction,none}
#    followed by the correct number of parameters on the same line
# the following example defines a full set of parameters for two channels
